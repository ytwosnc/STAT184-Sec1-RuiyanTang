# STAT184-HW-Berkeley
# Introduction
The qmd file in this Repo is about the study on UCB's potential admission bias in 1973. For the data included, we have 4 columns and 12,763 applications and their results.

# Methods and Graphs chosen
First, some basic statistics will be given on each gender's admission rate, which is 34.5% for female applicants and 44.5% for male applicants.
Then, sight will be cast on gender difference across different majors, both from absolute numbers and relative ratios. Bar charts and stack bar charts are used to represent gender difference.

Above is the Stack bar chart for Percentage of applications across each major and gender, the spotted line is 50%. Other graphs can be viewed in sample-graphs folder in main branch.

# Results and Conclusions
The admission rate for all other majors (Male higher) shows that gender bias still exist, but the reason is rather complicated. To view and better understand the detailed study and conclusion, see the bottom of .qmd file in code folder.
